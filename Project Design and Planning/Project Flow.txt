  Project Flow:

     - The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to upload the image as input
     - The uploaded image is analyzed by the model which is integrated
     - Once the model analyses the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI


To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

  - Understanding the data.
      - Importing the required libraries
      - Loading the data
      - Analyzing the data
      - Reshaping the data.
      - Applying One Hot Encoding
  - Model Building
      - Creating the model and adding the input, hidden and output layers to it
      - Compiling the model
      - Training the model
      - Predicting the result
      - Testing the model by taking image inputs
      - Saving the model
  - Application Building
      - Create an HTML file
      - Build Python Code
